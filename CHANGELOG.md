# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## 2.0.0

- Change underlying driver from [`mongodb`](https://github.com/elixir-mongo/mongodb) to [`mongodb_driver`](https://github.com/zookzook/elixir-mongodb-driver) 1.4
- Remove config options `pool`, `pool_overflow`, and `pool_timeout`
- Add support for MongoDB 6.0 and 7.0
- Add support for loading & dumping nil binaries and dumping nil dates
- Improve README setup instructions

### Possible breaking changes

Calls to the Ecto adapter itself should not require any changes. However, if you make direct calls to the `Mongo` driver, you will need to update some of them to account for the `mongodb` -> `mongodb_driver` upgrade. See [Migrating to 2.0](./README.md#migrating-to-20) in the Readme.

## 1.1.2

- Add support for loading nil dates

## 1.1.1

- Allow `binary_id` fields to be nil

## 1.1.0

## 1.0.0

- Use MongoDB 1.0.0 to add support for Mongodb 4.4. and 5.0

- NOTE: This might work with versions of Ecto less than 3.6.
  Refer to the ecto-3 branch if you need to find a commit that works with a non-officially supported version
  of Ecto.
